# NNIR
Neural Network Image Recognition 
The project focuses on image recognition by building a neural network using python. There are explanations for almost every block of the code so the reader can follow up. The hyperparameters used on this code are for practice usage. The output can probably yield better results by adjusting those parameters or by adding more i.e. a learning rate.
