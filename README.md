# NNIR
The project focuses on image recognition (handwritten digits from mnist) by building a deep neural network using python. There are explanations for almost every block of the code so the reader can follow up. The hyperparameters used on this code are for practical purposes. The output can probably yield better results by adjusting those parameters.
